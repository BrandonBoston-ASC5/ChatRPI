1. Tensors as Multi-dimensional Arrays:
Tensors in PyTorch can be thought of as multi-dimensional arrays. A 1D tensor is similar to a vector, a 2D tensor is like 
a matrix, and higher-dimensional tensors can be visualized as arrays with more dimensions.


2. Creation and Initialization:
Tensors can be created in various ways, either by specifying the data directly or using predefined functions. You can 
initialize tensors with zeros, ones, or random values.


3. Attributes of Tensors:
Each tensor has attributes like shape, data type (dtype), and the device it resides on (CPU or GPU). Understanding these 
attributes is crucial for manipulating tensors effectively.


4. Operations on Tensors:
Tensors support a rich set of operations, including element-wise operations, linear algebra operations, and mathematical 
functions. These operations enable you to perform computations efficiently on large datasets.


5. Automatic Differentiation (Autograd):
PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, called Autograd, allows tensors to keep track of operations performed on them. 
When a tensor has requires_grad set to True, it enables the computation of gradients during backpropagation. This feature 
is essential for training neural networks.


6. Tensor Operations and GPU Acceleration:
Tensors in PyTorch can take advantage of GPU acceleration. Moving tensors to a GPU can significantly speed up computations, 
especially in deep learning tasks where large amounts of data need to be processed.


7. Memory Management:
Understanding how PyTorch manages memory is important. Tensors can be created on the CPU or GPU, and PyTorch automatically 
handles memory allocation and deallocation.


8. Broadcasting:
Similar to NumPy, PyTorch supports broadcasting, allowing operations between tensors of different shapes. This simplifies 
code and makes it more concise.


9. Indexing and Slicing:
Tensors can be indexed and sliced to extract specific elements or subarrays. This is crucial for working with different parts of the data.


10. Grad_fn and Backpropagation:
Each tensor has a grad_fn attribute, which points to the operation that created it. This information is used during 
backpropagation to compute gradients. Understanding how this works is key to training neural networks effectively. In 
summary, PyTorch tensors serve as the foundation for building and training neural networks. They provide a flexible and 
efficient way to represent and manipulate data, making them a core component of deep learning workflows.
