1. Initialization:
At the beginning, the neural network's parameters (weights and biases) are initialized randomly. These parameters 
determine how the network transforms input data into predictions.


2. Forward Pass:
During the forward pass, input data is fed into the neural network. The data propagates through the network layer by layer, 
and the final layer produces predictions. Each layer performs a linear transformation (weighted sum) followed by a non-linear 
activation function. The predicted output is compared to the ground truth labels using a loss function, which measures the 
difference between predicted and actual values.


3. Loss Calculation:
The loss function quantifies the error in the predictions. The goal is to minimize this error during training.
Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.


4. Backward Pass (Backpropagation):
Backpropagation is a key concept in training neural networks. It involves computing the gradient of the loss with respect 
to each parameter using the chain rule of calculus. The gradients indicate how much the loss would increase or decrease 
if the corresponding parameter values are adjusted. Gradients are calculated backward through the network.


5. Optimization:
An optimizer uses the gradients to update the network's parameters, reducing the loss. Common optimizers include Stochastic 
Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during optimization.


6. Iterative Training:
Steps 2-5 are repeated for multiple epochs (passes through the entire training dataset). Each epoch refines the model 
parameters, improving its ability to make accurate predictions.


7. Generalization:
The goal is not only to minimize the training loss but also to generalize well to unseen data. This is achieved by 
evaluating the model on a separate validation set during training. Adjustments may be made to prevent overfitting, such 
as adding regularization techniques (dropout, weight decay).


8. Evaluation on Test Set:
Once training is complete, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance on unseen data.


9. Fine-Tuning and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Experimentation with hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) and model architecture may be necessary to achieve optimal performance.
This step involves a combination of domain expertise and trial-and-error.


10. Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, it can be deployed for making predictions on new, unseen data.
Understanding these conceptual steps provides a foundation for navigating the intricacies of training neural networks. 
It's important to strike a balance between model complexity, training time, and generalization to achieve a well-performing 
model for a specific task.
