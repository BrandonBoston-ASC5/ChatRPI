This text provides a comprehensive introduction to automatic differentiation, computation graphs, and the PyTorch library. It covers key concepts such as the forward and backward pass, computation graphs, gradients, and the dynamic computation graph nature of PyTorch.

Here's a breakdown of the major sections and concepts covered:

1. Introduction to Automatic Differentiation (Autograd): The text emphasizes the significance of automatic differentiation 
in deep learning libraries and highlights PyTorch's Autograd as a tool to understand this concept. It explains the two phases 
of training a neural network: the forward pass and the backward pass.

2. A Toy Example: A simple neural network with five neurons is introduced, and the text walks through the computation of gradients 
for each learnable parameter using the chain rule.

Consider a neural network with the following structure:

   a
   |
   ↓
   w1     w2
   |      |
   ↓      ↓
   b ←─ w3 ─→ c
   |         |
   ↓         ↓
   w4        w5
   |         |
   ↓         ↓
   d ←─────── L

In this network:

a, b, c, d: Represent the neurons.
w1, w2, w3, w4, w5: Denote the learnable weights.
L: Represents the loss function.
Equations Describing the Neural Network:
The relationships between these variables are given by the following equations:

b=w1⋅a
c=w2⋅a
d=w3⋅b+w4⋅c
L=10−d
Gradients Calculation using Chain Rule:
To compute the gradients for each learnable parameter w, the chain rule is applied. Here's a breakdown:

Gradient with respect to 
w4:

∂w4 / ∂L = (∂d /∂L) ⋅ (∂c / ∂d) ⋅ (∂w4 / ∂c)
​
 
Gradient with respect to 
w3:

∂w3 / ∂L = (∂d / ∂L) ⋅ (∂b / ∂d) ⋅ (∂w3 / ∂b)
​
 
Gradient with respect to 
w2:

∂w2 / ∂L = (∂d / ∂L) ⋅ (∂c / ∂d) ⋅ (∂w2 / ∂c)
​
 
Gradient with respect to 
w1:

∂w1 / ∂L = (∂d / ∂L) ⋅ (∂b / ∂d) ⋅ (∂w1 / ∂b)
​
 
Computation Graph:
The computation graph for this example represents the flow of operations in the neural network. Each node corresponds to 
an operation, and the edges represent the flow of data. It's a directed acyclic graph (DAG) capturing the dependencies between variables.

Backward Pass:
During the backward pass (backpropagation), the gradients are computed and propagated through the computation graph. 
Starting from the loss L, gradients are calculated for each parameter w using the chain rule, and the values are updated accordingly.

Conclusion:
This toy example serves as a foundational understanding of how gradients are computed in a neural network. It illustrates the importance of the chain rule and how it is applied in the context of PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine (Autograd).


3. Computation Graphs: The concept of computation graphs is introduced as a data structure that represents the operations 
in a neural network. The text explains how nodes in a computation graph correspond to operators and how the graph helps in 
computing gradients seamlessly.

4. PyTorch Autograd: The implementation of the discussed concepts in PyTorch is explained. It covers Tensors, requires_grad attribute, 
grad_fn, backward propagation, and the role of the Function class in PyTorch's Autograd.

5. Differences from TensorFlow Graphs: Contrasts are drawn between PyTorch's dynamic computation graphs and TensorFlow's 
static computation graphs. The dynamic nature of PyTorch allows changes in the network architecture during runtime, providing flexibility.

6. Tricks of the Trade:

requires_grad: An attribute of the Tensor class is highlighted, allowing the freezing of layers during training.

torch.no_grad(): A context manager in PyTorch is introduced, useful during inference to avoid unnecessary graph creation and memory consumption.
Conclusion: The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding Autograd and computation graphs in PyTorch, 
paving the way for future posts on creating custom architectures and data pipelines.

7. Conclusion: Overall, the tutorial provides a solid foundation for beginners 
to understand the core concepts of automatic differentiation, computation graphs, 
and their implementation in PyTorch.
